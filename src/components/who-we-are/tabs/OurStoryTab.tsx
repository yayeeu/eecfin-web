            The Ethiopian Evangelical Church in Finland (EECFIN) was established to serve the spiritual
            needs of Ethiopian Christians living in Finland. Over the years, we have grown in numbers and impact, serving both the Ethiopian community and reaching out to others.

          <p>
            Today, EECFIN continues to be a place of worship, fellowship, and community service,
            welcoming all who seek to grow in their faith and serve the community.
